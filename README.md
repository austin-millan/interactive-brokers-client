# Interactive Brokers OpenAPI Specification (Unofficial)

## About

Interactive Brokers  uses the OpenAPI (OAI) Specification to describe its REST APIs.
This unofficial specification is based on [https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/swagger-ui.html](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/swagger-ui.html),
but in contrast to the offficial specification, this one will provide you with a single OAI v3 file that can be used
directly for code generation and other benefits of OAI.
